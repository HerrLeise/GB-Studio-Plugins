# HL Enhanced Visual Dialogues

With Enhanced Visual Dialogues you can use a 9-Frame Sprite to fill 9 actors in a 3x3 array to show a person or thing that communicates.


**Build, run, tested on GB-Studio 2.0b5**

**Limitations**
You cannot display 2 Dialogue Actors at the same time, due to Frame and Actor restrictions in GB-Studio 2.0b5
